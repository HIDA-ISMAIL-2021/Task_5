## 📊 Summary of Findings

- **Population Distribution**:  
  Highly skewed; majority of countries have low populations, a few have very high populations (e.g., China, India).

- **Area vs Population**:  
  No strong correlation; large countries like Russia have low population density, while small countries like Bangladesh are densely populated.

- **Continental Trends**:  
  Asia has the widest spread and highest median population.

- **Key Insights**:
  - Smaller countries tend to have higher population densities.
  - Larger areas do not guarantee higher population.
  - Economic, geographic, and political factors influence these patterns.
